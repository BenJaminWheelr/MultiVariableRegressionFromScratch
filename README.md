# Multivariable Linear Regression From Scratch

This project implements a multivariable linear regression model from scratch using Python. The model is trained to predict a target variable based on multiple input features. The implementation focuses on understanding the underlying mathematics of linear regression, particularly gradient descent optimization.

## Features

- **Multivariable Linear Regression**: Predicts an output variable from multiple input variables.
- **Gradient Descent**: Implements gradient descent to minimize the cost function and find the best-fitting model.
- **Residual Sum of Squares (RSS)**: Uses RSS as the cost function for optimization.
- **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**: Uses RMSE to put accuracy in an understandable format.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles data normalization and splitting into training and test datasets.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- numpy
- pandas (for data manipulation)
