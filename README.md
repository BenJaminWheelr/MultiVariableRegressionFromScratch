Multivariable Linear Regression From Scratch
  This project implements a multivariable linear regression model from scratch using Python. The model is trained to predict a target variable based on multiple input features. The implementation focuses on understanding the underlying mathematics of linear regression, particularly gradient descent optimization.

Features
  Multivariable Linear Regression: Predicts an output variable from multiple input variables.
  Gradient Descent: Implements gradient descent to minimize the cost function and find the best-fitting model.
  Residual Sum Squares (RSS): Uses RSS as the cost function for optimization.
  Root Mean Squares Error (RMSE): Uses RMSE to put accuracy in understandable format. 
Data Preprocessing: Handles data normalization and splitting into training and test datasets.
  Requirements
  Python 3.x
  numpy
  pandas (for data manipulation)
